      <p>Power management tools for Raspberry Pi.</p>
      <p>When operating from solar panels or batteries reducing unnecessary power consumption
      can make the Raspberry run more reliably, for longer. This simple command line tool allows

      <h2>sound device control</h2>
      <p>Easily install and configure sound devices on the Raspberry Pi.</p>
      <p>For deployments of Raspberry Pi based acoustic sensors with multiple different sound
      capture hardware this tool provides a standard interface for sound device control as well 
      as a standardised installation script. This software simplifies device setup and control
      for any number of Raspberry Pi devices, although the greatest benefit will come in managing
      deployments of large, heterogenous networks.
